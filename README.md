postman is a [**Minecraft**](https://minecraft.net) client intended for use on servers which allow client-side modification. postman is written in 100% java (very based programming language) for the latest version of [**Fabric**](https://fabricmc.net/). the current version of the client is heavily based off it's [***legacy***](https://github.com/srgantmoomoo/postman/legacy) version which was written for [**Forge**](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/) 1.12.2. i intend for this project to be heavily community driven, open source, open access, open development, and available to all for free!

# instructions
**download**
1. postman uses forge in order to run so, if you havent already, go [**here**](http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html) and download the latest or recommended version of forge 1.12.2 (make sure you run this download of forge in minecraft at least once before continuing). <br />
2. head to the [**releases**](https://github.com/srgantmoomoo/postman/releases) section of this repositroy; select the latest version (or your preferred version), find assets at the bottom of the release, then download the .jar file. <br />
3. find the location of your .minecraft directory. for windows users, type %appdata% in your windows search and hit enter. open the .minecraft directory and open the mods directory (if there is no mods folder than you can create one yourself). open the 1.12.2 directory (once again you can create your own if needed).
5. drag the postman .jar file that you downloaded earlier into the 1.12.2 folder. <br />
- if you want to take advantage of postman's baritone integration, you can download the [**baritone api**](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/releases/download/v1.2.14/baritone-api-forge-1.2.14.jar) and drag it into your mods folder along with postman.

**use**
- prefix is "," (comma) by default.
- clickgui is bound to rshift by default.
- once your clickgui is opened you will see a bunch of categories, you can drag these around and right click them to open them.
- each category has different modules you may enable by left clicking.
- you can open the settings for a module by right clicking the module. 
- the settings consist of booleans (enable or disable), numbers (sliders to change the value of something), modes (switches modes), and colors (right click to configure). 
- you can rebind each module in the settings by clicking keybind (at the bottom of each modules settings), and clicking the button you want to bind the module to.
- esc to close the clickgui 0_0.

**development**
- jdk 8 required.
- gradlew setupDecompWorkspace should be ran before anything (if your using intellij, it should take care of it for you).
- gradlew eclipse (for eclipse users) or gradlew genIntellijRuns (for intellij users).
